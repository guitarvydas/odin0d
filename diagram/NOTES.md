It looks like I fell way behind thanks to the week-long exercise of just getting Odin to run.

I pulled the stuff from master and am browsing through it.  The stuff in demo_basics looks real familiar but the stuff in demo_drawio is a pleasant surprise.

It looks like you can code this stuff up way, way, way faster than I can.

How's your time? I have no need to write code and would gladly punt all of that to you, if it doesn't interfere with the rest of your weekend plans.

My plan:
1. Deal with Sequential and Parallel Odin0D. I'm writing about what I see in demo_basics, but, if that can be lifted to draw.io, then all the better.  Can this all be done from draw.io now?

2. Undo some garbage I pushed to the vsh repo and get it back to where it was a decade ago.

3. Start re-coding vsh. It ain't rocket science.  IIRC there are only 10 very simple parts (that didn't seem so simple a decade ago :-) that are written in a couple of lines of PROLOG each, and again in Lisp.  Then there's grash.c which is just a really, really simple C program.  I would have to spend the rest of the weekend learning enough about Odin to re-code grash.c, but, other than that there is very little there and can be explained easily.
